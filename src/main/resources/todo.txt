Local:
- clean up conf
- unit tests
- log everything before writing it to memory
- clear log after flush to disk
- shutdown should flush memstore
- implement recovery using logs (i.e. on restart, if we have a log that hasn't been properly flushed yet, flush it to disk)
- implement update and delete

 Distributed:
 - raft? need to do a bit more research (BigTable uses Paxos, so hopefully can do something similar)
