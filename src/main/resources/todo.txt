Local:
- implement delete (we can say that value length of -1 means it's deleted. on compaction we can just eliminate that record entirely.)
- implement update (in-memory, latest value wins; from disk, value with latest file timestamp wins)
- make sure file index is persisted
- test basic persistence (restart)
- clean up conf
- decide whether we want non-flushed writes to be readable after shutdown. if yes:
--> log everything before writing it to memory (awesomely, this log can just be the file that will represent the actual data)
--> clear log after flush to disk
--> shutdown/close should flush memstore
--> implement recovery using logs (i.e. on restart, if we have a log that hasn't been properly flushed yet, flush it to disk)
- compaction
- bloom filters
- add pools for getting tables (may need to think about concurrency issues)

 Distributed:
 - raft? need to do a bit more research (BigTable uses Paxos, so hopefully can do something similar)
